# Image-Extension-Changer
I have created a simple image extension changer in vanilla javascript.
#Features
1. You can upload a picture with extensions (jpg, png, gif, bmp, webp)
2. You can select from 3 3 extensions you want to export your image in (webp, jpg, png)
3. Interface is visually appealing
